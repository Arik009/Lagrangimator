# Lagrangimator
The project aims to simulate and visualize Lagrangian points dynamically within a two-mass gravitational system using computer vision (CV) and electronic components. Lagrangian points are positions in space where the gravitational forces of two massive objects and the centrifugal force are in equilibrium. These points have critical applications in space missions and celestial mechanics.
This system integrates stepper motors, sensors, a camera, and a microcontroller to create a physical representation of a simplified two-mass system. By combining real-time position tracking and hardware movement, we can dynamically calculate and display the positions of Lagrangian points. This project serves as an innovative tool for students and enthusiasts to explore celestial mechanics interactively.
Project Objectives
Simulate a simplified two-mass gravitational system.
Use computer vision to detect the position of two physical masses in real time.
Calculate and display the Lagrangian points dynamically on a screen or overlay using AR in Unity.
Establish communication between Arduino and Unity using pyserial and a TCP client.
Integrate stepper motors and linear actuators to update the positions in real time depending on input from the user, based on the polar coordinate system.
